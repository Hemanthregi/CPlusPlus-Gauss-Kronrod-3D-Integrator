# CPlusPlus-Gauss-Kronrod-3D-Integrator
This program implements a highly flexible 3D quadrature integrator that supports both Gauss-Kronrod and Gauss-Legendre rules. It is designed to handle extremely high precision by supporting Kronrod grids from 15 up to 1,023 points (and Legendre from 7 up to 511 points).
